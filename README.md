### Description of Project:
The aim of the Cluster Analysis of Stocks was to mine extensive longitudinal American stock/etf market data to identify useful clusters that could potentially be used to make better financial decisions.

### Summary of Questions Sought and Answers:
Our analysis aimed to cluster individual stocks into groups to see what stocks tend to move together, and this was the main question we aimed to answer.
In particular, our main question was "what are some stock movement relationships that are not logical or common knowledge" as these are some of the most valuable and useful types of relationships.

The answer to our questions sought is actually comprised of many different stock movement relations observations. There are potentially a massive number of these different combinations of stocks that move together, but one of the most interesting relations that we uncovered was that the American automakers (GM and Ford) tend to move with large steel companies, but foreign automakers (Honda in this case) tend to not move with steel manufacturers. With the results of our clustering analysis, it's likely that even more interesting relations could be uncovered in the hands of a skilled analyst and answer our sought questions even more fully.

### Applications:
Our clustering model has many meaningful impacts for both the common investor as well as a professional. In particular, the data gleaned from our model can allow for effective portfolio diversification (by selecting stocks from different clusters) as well as the ability to find subtle links between companies that tend to move together. All of this can be accomplished without significant financial domain knowledge, which is in itself valuable, increasing the usability and accessibility of our model among different types of investors.
